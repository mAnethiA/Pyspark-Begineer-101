# Spark Data Processing: User Log Analysis Practice

This repository contains a practice notebook where I explored **Apache Spark** and **PySpark** for processing and analyzing a user log dataset. The notebook demonstrates various data processing techniques using Spark, including data cleaning, transformations, and aggregations.

> **Note**: This notebook is based on a Kaggle notebook that I used to practice **Apache Spark**. It serves as a hands-on practice environment to familiarize myself with Spark's functionalities.

## Dataset

### Data Download

To download the dataset, you can use the following code snippet in your notebook:

```python
import kagglehub

# Download latest version
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("nilaychauhan/sparkify-log-small")

print("Path to dataset files:", path)
